# Digit-Recogniser-Web-Application

This project is a Deep Learning-based application that recognizes handwritten digits. The model used in this application is based on Convolutional Neural Networks Sequential model. The Handwritten MNIST dataset has been used for training and testing the model, which consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images.
